# Game overview
_Project Pandora : Grim Cargo_ is a two-player game in which one player commands the human Marines of the mighty Corporation while the other controls the shadowy forces of the Veer-myn.
The game is set on a spaceship: the merchant vessel _CSS Zloveshy Vassily_, affectionately known to the crew as the _Grim Cargo_.
The Marines guard a secret shipment of highly classified material called verminium.
The Veer-myn want it for themselves.

There are six scenarios to choose from, and each uses the tiles provided with this game to make a different board.
In each scenario you control a number of models representing your warriors, which you move across the board and use to fight your opponent's models to achieve the scenario's objective.
Different scenarios have different ways of winning, so you need skill and cunning to adapt your tactics to each challenge.

Each side has its strengths and weaknesses that combine to form a unique style of play.
By swapping sides and trying each scenario from both perspectives, you can gain a better understanding of how both forces work.
