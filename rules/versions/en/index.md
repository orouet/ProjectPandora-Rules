## Game overview
_Project Pandora : Grim Cargo_ is a two-player game in which one player commands the human Marines of the mighty Corporation while the other controls the shadowy forces of the Veer-myn.
The game is set on a spaceship: the merchant vessel _CSS Zloveshy Vassily_, affectionately known to the crew as the _Grim Cargo_.
The Marines guard a secret shipment of highly classified material called verminium.
The Veer-myn want it for themselves.

There are six scenarios to choose from, and each uses the tiles provided with this game to make a different board.
In each scenario you control a number of models representing your warriors, which you move across the board and use to fight your opponent's models to achieve the scenario's objective.
Different scenarios have different ways of winning, so you need skill and cunning to adapt your tactics to each challenge.

Each side has its strengths and weaknesses that combine to form a unique style of play.
By swapping sides and trying each scenario from both perspectives, you can gain a better understanding of how both forces work.

## Preparing to play
Before you play for the first time you will need to carefully push the card pieces from their frames and assemble some of the models.

If you are an experienced modeller, these models should pose no problems for you.
If you have note assemble miniatures before, you will be happy to know that these kits are simple to put together.
Most just need arms and a head sticking onto a body, and it's easy to see where everything fits.

First, read Scenario 101 and have a look at the models parts.
Sort out enough pieces to assemble only the models you need for this first game, so you can get playing as soon as possible.
Be aware that the arms are designed to work as pairs so they hold the weapons properly.
Use the photos as reference and try fitting them together without glue in a "dry run" to check they look right.
When you're happy with your selection then stick them together.

If you're keen to play right away, you can temporarily assemble the models using adhesive putty (such as Blu-Tack, Elmer's Tack or Buddies).
Once you've had a game or two then you can assemble the models permanently.

Once they are assembled, most gamers like to paint their models to show them off at their best.
Have a look at the photos in this game and on the Mantic website for inspiration.
There are some suggested colour schemes, but don't let this limit your imagination.
You choose the paint scheme you like best!

Always be sure to follow the safety instructions on all your tools and glues.

### The models
The models in this game represents a number of different types of futuristic warrior.
The Corporation are mostly high trained human Marines, and are led by the grizzled Sergeant Cruise.
The Veer-myn ranks are commanded by Master Reekish, and are composed of Night-crawlers and an Exterminator armed with a chem-thrower (see the game box for details).
